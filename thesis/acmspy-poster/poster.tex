    \begin{block}{Code-Breaking Games}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item 2 players: \emph{codemaker} and \emph{codebreaker}
      \item Codemaker selects a \emph{secret code}
      \item Codebreaker strives to reveal the code through a series of \emph{experiments} whose outcomes give partial information about the code
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example: Mastermind}

      \begin{column}{\parindent}\end{column}
      \begin{column}{.78\textwidth}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Secret code: combination of $n$ \emph{coloured pegs}
        \item Codebreaker makes guesses (experiments)
        \item Guesses are evaluated with \emph{black and white markers}
        \item Black marker = correct both colour and position
        \item White marker = the colour is present at a different position
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Problem of finding an odd-weight coin using balance scale
        \item Secret code: identity of the unique counterfeit coin 
        \item Codebreaker puts coins on the balance scale and observes the outcome (the left pan is lighter / heavier / same)

    \begin{block}{Questions and Problems}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item How should the codebreaker play in order to minimize the number of experiments needed to undoubtedly determine the code?
      \item Is there a strategy for experiment selection that guarantees revealing the code after at most $k$ experiments?
      \item What strategy is optimal with respect to the average-case number of experiments, given that the code is selected from the given set with uniform distribution?
