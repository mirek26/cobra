      \begin{itemize}
      \item 2 players: \emph{codemaker} and \emph{codebreaker}
      \item Codemaker selects a \emph{secret code}
      \item Codebreaker strives to reveal the code through a series of \emph{experiments} whose outcomes give partial information about the code
      % \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Mastermind

        \item Secret code: combination of $n$ \emph{coloured pegs}
        \item Codebreaker makes guesses (experiments)
        \item Guesses are evaluated with \emph{black and white markers}
        \item Black marker = correct both colour and position
        \item White marker = the colour is present at a different position

      \begin{quote}
      How should the codebreaker play in order to minimize the number of~experiments needed to undoubtedly determine the code?
      \end{quote}
      \begin{quote}
      Is there a strategy for experiment selection that guarantees revealing the~code after at most $k$ experiments?
      \end{quote}
      \begin{quote}
      What strategy is optimal with respect to the average-case number of~experiments, given that the code is selected from the given set with uniform distribution?
      \end{quote}


      \begin{itemize}
      \item We create a computer program that reads a specification of a code-breaking game, performs automatic analysis and answers these questions
