\begin{ThesisAbstract}
% Markov decision processes provide us with a mathematical framework
%   for modeling decision-making in randomized systems,
%   where a scheduler controls the behavior of the system through the decisions.
% Continuous-time Markov decision processes introduce
%   exponentially distributed time delays on the transitions to the model.
% Time-bounded reachability objective asks for a scheduler maximizing
%   the probability of reaching a set of goal states in a given time limit.

% Methods for computing optimal and $\eps$-optimal schedulers
%   are available but they do not take into consideration
%   the size of representation of such schedulers.
% Indeed, the resulting schedulers can be very large and their potential usage
%   in embedded systems, for example, is questionable.
% Hence, the thesis focuses on the size of schedulers and examines
%   the problem of finding a minimal optimal ($\eps$-optimal) scheduler
%   with respect to the time-bounded reachability.

% We propose an algorithm computing a minimal $\eps$-optimal scheduler
%   for a given discrete-time system.
% For continuous-time processes, we adopt the discretization technique
%   to reduce the problem to the discrete-time case.
