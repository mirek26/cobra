\begin{ThesisAbstract}
Code-breaking games are two-player games in which the first player selects
  a code from a given set and the second player strives to reveal it using a
  minimal number of experiments.
A prominent example of a code-breaking game is the board game Mastermind,
  where the codebreaker tries to guess a combination of coloured pegs.

There are many natural questions regarding code-breaking games.
What strategy for experiment selection should the codebreaker use?
Is it possible to compute a lower or upper bound for the number of experiments needed?
Can we compute the optimal strategy?
What is the performance of a given heuristic?
Much research on the topic has been done but it usually focuses
  on one particular game and little has been written about code-breaking
  games in general.

In this work, we create a general model of code-breaking games
  based on propositional logic
  and design a computer language for game specification.
Further, we suggest general algorithms for game analysis and strategy synthesis
  and implement them in a computer program.
Using the tool, we can reproduce existing results for Mastermind,
  analyse new code-breaking games and easily evaluate new heuristics
  for experiment selection.
