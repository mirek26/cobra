\chapter{Code-breaking game model} \label{ch:model}

In this chapter, we formally define code-breaking games
  within the framework of propositional logic,
  where we represent a secret code as a valuation
  of propositional variables.
We discuss various strategies for code-breaking games and
  define a concept of experiment equivalence,
  which is fundamental for strategy synthesis and analysis.

\section{Notation and terminology}
For a set $X$, notation $X^n$ is used to denote sequences of $X$ of length $n$
  and $X^*$ denotes all finite sequences of $X$.
The $k$-th element of a sequence $s \in X^*$ is denoted by $s[k]$.

Let $\Form_\Var$ denote the set of propositional formulas over
  the set of variables $\Var$ and let
  $\Val_\Var$ be the set of valuations (boolean interpretations)
  of variables $\Var$.
Apart from standard logical operators, we allow $n$-ary numerical operators
  $\exactlyk{k}\!$, $\atleastk{k}\!$, $\atmostk{k}\!$.
For a valuation $v\in\Val_\Var$ and propositional formulas
  $\form_1, ...,\form_n\in\Form_\Var$,
  the operator $\exactlyk{k}$ has the semantics
  $\val(\exactlyk{k}(\form_1,...,\form_n)) = 1$ if and only if
  $|\{i \| v(\form_i) = 1 \}| = k$.
The semantics of $\atmost$ and $\atleast$ is defined analogically.

Formulas $\form_0, \form_1 \in \Form_\Var$ are equivalent,
  written $\form_0 \equiv \form_1$, if
  $\val(\form_0) = \val(\form_1)$ for all $\val\in\Val_\Var$.
We say that \emph{$\val$ is a model of $\form$}
  or that \emph{$\val$ satisfies $\form$}
  if $\val(\form) = 1$.
For a formula $\form\in\Form_\Var$, let
  $\numval_{\!_\Var}{\form} = |\{ \val\in\Val_\Var \| \val(\form) = 1 \}|$
  be the number of models of $\form$.
We often omit the index $\Var$ if it is clear from the context.

The set of all permutations of a set $\Var$ (bijections $\Var->\Var$)
  is denoted by $\Perm_\Var$ and
  $\idperm_\Var$ is the identity permutation.
A \emph{partition} $P$ of a set $X$ is a set of disjoint subsets of $X$,
  union of which is equal to $X$.
Members of $P$ are called \emph{cells}.
Let $P(x)$ be the cell containing $x$,
  i.e. $P(x) = A$, where $A\in P$ and $x\in A$.

% DEF: CODE BREAKING GAME
\section{Basic definitions}

A code-breaking game can be represented by a \emph{set of variables},
  \emph{initial constraint} (a formula that is guaranteed to be satisfied),
  and a set of \emph{allowed experiments}.
An experiment is defined by the set of possible outcomes in which it can result.
The outcomes are specified in the form of a propositional formula that
  represents the partial information
  that the codebreaker gains if the experiment results in the outcome.

The number of experiments in a code-breaking game is typically very large.
For example, in the counterfeit coin problem defined in \autoref{s:coins},
  experiments correspond to combinations of coins you put on the pans of the
  balance scale.
It can be calculated that there are 36,894 combinations for 12 coins.
However, most of them have the same structure,
  so it would be inefficient to specify them one by one.
Therefore we choose a compact representation with \emph{parametrized experiments},
  where parametrization is a fixed-length string over a defined alphabet.
This whole idea is formalized below.

\begin{definition}[Code-breaking game] \label{def:game}
A \emph{code-breaking game} is a quintuple
  $\game = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \Expt)$, where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\Var$ is a finite set of propositional variables,
  \item $\init \in \Form_\Var$ is a satisfiable propositional formula,
  %\item $\Expt$ is a finite set of types of experiments,
  \item $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet,
  \item $F$ is a collection of mappings of type $\Sigma -> \Var$,
  \item $\Expt$ is a set of \emph{parametrized experiments}, defined below.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Parametrized experiment] \label{def:exp}
A \emph{parametrized experiment} for a game
  $\game = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \Expt)$
  is a triple
  $\expt = (n, P, \outcome)$, where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $n$ is the number of parameters of the experiment,
  \item $P$ is a partition of the set $\{1, ..., n\}$,
  \item $\outcome$ is a set of parametrized formulas, defined below.
  \end{itemize}
If $k$ and $l$ are in the same cell of the partition $P$, then the $k$-th and
the $l$-th parameter must be different.
We denote the components of a parametrized experiment $t\in\Expt$
  by $n_t$, $P_t$, and $\outcome_t$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Parametrized formula] \label{def-pform}
The set of all \emph{parametrized formulas} for a parametrized experiment
$t$ of a game $\game = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \Expt)$
  is the set of
  all strings $\pform$ generated by the following grammar, specified in Backusâ€“Naur Form.
\begin{align*}
\msymb{form} &::= x \| f(\$k) \| \msymb{form} \circ \msymb{form} \| O(\msymb{form-list})  \| \neg\; \msymb{form},\\
\msymb{form-list} &::= \msymb{form-list} \;,\; \msymb{form} \| \msymb{form}
\end{align*}
  where $x\in\Var$ is a propositional variable, $f\in F$ is a mapping, $1<= k <= n_t$ is a parameter index,
  $\circ\in\{\wedge, \vee, ==>\}$ is a standard logical operator,
  and $O\in\{ \exactlyk{k}, \atmostk{k}, \atleastk{k} \| k\in\Nset\}$ is
  a numerical operator.
The special notation $\$k$ in $f(\$k)$ is used to denote the $k$-th parameter.
\end{definition}

The set $\Exp$ of all experiments in the game $\game$ is given by
\[
  \Exp =
     \big\{ (\expt, \param) \| t\in\Expt,\; \param \in\Sigma^{n_t},\;
     \forall x,y<={n_t}:\; P_t(x)=P_t(y) ==> \param[x] \not= \param[y] \big\}
\]

An experiment $e\in\Exp$ is thus a pair $(t, p)$, where
  $t$ is referred to as the \emph{type of the experiment},
 and $p$ is referred to as its \emph{parametrization}.

Let $e = (t, p)\in\Exp$ be an experiment,
  and $\pform\in\outcome_t$ a parametrized formula.
By $\pform(\param)$ we denote the application of
  the parametrization $\param$ on $\pform$,
  which is defined recursively on the structure of $\pform$
  in the following way:
\begin{align}
(x)(\param) &= x, \\
(f(\$k))(\param) &= f(\param[k]),\\
(\pform_1\circ\pform_2)(\param) &= \pform_1(\param) \circ \pform_2(\param),\\
O(\pform_1, ..., \pform_m)(\param) &= O(\pform_1(\param), ..., \pform_m(\param)),\\
(\neg\pform)(\param) &= \neg(\pform(\param)).
\end{align}

To simplify the notation, let us denote the set of possible outcomes for
  an experiment $\exp = (\expt, \param) \in \Exp$ by
  $\outcome(\exp) = \{ \pform(\param) \| \pform\in\outcome_\expt\}$.

\begin{example} \label{ex:run1}
Consider the counterfeit coin problem for 4 coins.
We use this game as a running example throughout this chapter.

The counterfeit coin and its relative weight to others can be encoded
  as a valuation of variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ and $y$,
  $v(x_i)$ being 1 if and only if the $i$-th coin is counterfeit and
  $y$ determining its relative weight
  ($v(y) = 0$ meaning lighter, $v(y) = 1$ meaning heavier).
The initial constraint $\init$ should capture the restriction that exactly one
  coin if counterfeit.
Therefore, let $\init$ be $\exactlyk{1}(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$.

The experiments are parametrized by the coins on the pans of the balance scale.
Let $\Sigma = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $F = \{ f_x \}$ where $f_x$
maps $i$ to the corresponding variable $x_i$.

The first parametrized experiment $t$ is weighing one coin against one.
We need two parameters ($n_t = 2$),
  the first determining the coin on the left pan,
  the second determining the coin on the right pan that must be different
  from the first.
$P_t$ is therefore the trivial partition $\{\{1, 2\}\}$.

If the left pan is lighter, it is either the case that the
  coin on the left is underweight ($f_x(\$1) \wedge \neg y$)
  or the coin on the right is overweight ($f_x(\$2) \wedge y$).
If the right pan is lighter, we get symmetrical knowledge
  $(f_x(\$1)\wedge y) \vee (f_x(\$2)\wedge\neg y)$.
If both sides weigh the same, the counterfeit coins is not present on either pan
  and we can conclude $\neg f_x(\$1) \wedge \neg f_x(\$2)$.
To sum it up,
\begin{align*}
  t = \big(2,\; \big\{\{1,2\}\big\},\; \big\{ &
    (f_x(\$1)\wedge \neg y) \vee (f_x(\$2)\wedge y), \\
    & (f_x(\$1)\wedge y) \vee (f_x(\$2)\wedge\neg y), \\
    & \neg f_x(\$1) \wedge \neg f_x(\$2) \;\big\}\big).
\end{align*}

The second parametrized experiment is weighing two coins against two.
There are $4$ parameters, they must be pairwise distinct and the outcome
  formulas can be constructed analogically. \eqed
\end{example}


Note that the compact representation with parametrized experiments
  does not restrict the class of games that can fit \autoref{def:game},
  compared to a possible definition with direct experiment enumeration.
The thing is that there can always be a parametrized experiment
  with no parameters for each actual experiment.

\begin{definition}[Solving process]
An \emph{evaluated experiment} is a pair $(e, \form)$,
  where $e\in\Exp$ and $\form\in\outcome(e)$.
Let us denote the set of evaluated experiments by $\Omega$.

A \emph{solving process} is a finite or infinite sequence
  of evaluated experiments.
\end{definition}

Let $\proc$ be a solving process.
For simplicity, we omit parentheses around the pairs and write
  $\proc = \exp_1, \form_1, \exp_2, \form_2, ...$.
Let
\begin{itemize}
\item $|\proc|$ denote the length of the sequence,
\item $\proc(k) = \exp_k$ denote the $k$-th experiment,
\item $\proc[k] = \form_k$ denote the $k$-th outcome,
\item $\proc[1:k] = \exp_1, \form_1, ..., \exp_k, \form_k$ denote the prefix of length $k$, and
\item $\aknow{\proc}{k} = \init \wedge \form_1 \wedge ... \wedge \form_k$
  denote the accumulated knowledge after the first $k$ experiments
  (including the initial constraint $\init$). For finite $\proc$,
  let $\tknow{\proc} = \aknow{\proc}{|\proc|}$ be the overall accumulated knowledge.
\end{itemize}

We denote the set of valuations that satisfy $\init$ by $\Vals = \{ \val\in\Val_\Var \| \val(\init) = 1 \}$
  and the set of \emph{reachable formulas} by $\Formr = \{ \tknow{\proc} \| \proc\in\Omega^* \}$.

\subsection{Course of the game}

Let us now describe the course of the game in the defined terms.
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -3pt
\item The codemaker chooses a valuation $\val$ from $\Vals$.
\item The codebreaker chooses an experiment $e$ from $\Exp$.
\item The codemaker gives the codebreaker a formula
  $\form\in\outcome(e)$ that is satisfied by valuation $\val$.
  In order for the codemaker to always be able to do so,
  there must be a formula $\form\in\outcome(\exp)$ satisfied by any valuation
  in $\Vals$. This is defined below as \emph{well-formed} property of the game.
\item The evaluated experiment $(e, \form)$ is appended to the
  (initially empty) solving process $\proc$.
\item If $\numval{\tknow{\proc}} = 1$, the codebreaker can uniquely determine
the valuation $\val$ and the game ends. Otherwise, it continues with step 2.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Well-formed game] \label{def:wellformed}
A code-breaking game is \emph{well-formed} if for all $\exp \in \Exp$,
\begin{equation}
\forall\val\in\Vals.\;
  \exists \textrm{ exactly one }
     \form\in\outcome(\exp)\;.\; \val(\form) = 1
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

In the sequel, we focus only on well-formed games and, by default,
  we assume a game is well-formed unless otherwise stated.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% EXAMPLE: FAKE-COIN PROBLEM
\subsection{Examples}
In the rest of this section, we show two ways of defining the counterfeit coin
  problem and a formal definition of Mastermind.
We do not provide formal definitions of other code-breaking games
  presented in \autoref{ch:games},
  however, a computer language for game specification
  that is based on this formalism is introduced in \autoref{ch:cobra},
  and specifications of all the code-breaking games
  in this language can be found in the electronic attachment to the thesis.

\begin{example}[The counterfeit coin problem] \label{ex:cc1}
A formal definition of the counterfeit coin problem with 4 coins
  has already been introduced in \autoref{ex:run1}.
This is a straightforward generalization for $n$ coins.
We define a game $\mathcal{F}_n = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \Expt)$ with
the following components.

\begin{itemize}
\item
$\Var = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, y\}$.
  Variable $x_i$ tells whether coin $i$ is counterfeit,
  variable $y$ tells whether it is lighter or heavier.
\item
$\init = \exactlyk{1}(x_1, ..., x_n)$,
  saying that exactly one coin is counterfeit.

\item
$\Sigma = \{1, 2,...,n\}$, $F = \{ f_x \}$, where $f_x(i) = x_i$.
The experiments are parametrized with coins that are represented by numbers from 1 to $n$.

\item
$\Expt = \big\{ (2\cdot m,\; \{\{1,...,2m\}\},\; \outcome_m) \| 1 <= m <= n/2 \big\}$, where
\begin{flalign*}
\outcome_m = \big\{
& ((f_x(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$m)) \wedge \neg y) \vee ((f_x(\$m+1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$2m)) \wedge y), \\
& ((f_x(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$m)) \wedge y) \vee ((f_x(\$m+1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$2m)) \wedge \neg y), \\
& \neg (f_x(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$2m)) \big\}.
\end{flalign*}

For every $m\in\Nset$, $m <= n/2$, we have a parametrized experiment of weighing
  $m$ coins against $m$ coins.
It has $2m$ parameters, the first $m$ are put on the left pan, the last $m$ are put on the right pan.

There are 3 possible outcomes.
First, the left pan is lighter.
  This happens if the counterfeit coin is lighter and it appears
  among the first $m$ parameters,
  or if it is heavier and it appears among the last $m$ parameters.
Second, analogically, the right pan is lighter.
Third, both pans weigh the same if the
  counterfeit coin does not participate in the experiment.
\end{itemize}

For demonstration purposes, we show another possible formalization
  of the same problem.
Let $\mathcal{F'}_n = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \expt)$ be a game
  with the following components.

\begin{itemize}
\item
$\Var = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n,\: y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}$.
Variable $x_i$ tells that coin $i$ is lighter, variable $y_i$ tells that coin $i$ is heavier.
\item
$\init = \exactlyk{1}(x_1, ..., x_n, y_1, ..., y_n)$,
  saying that exactly one coin is odd-weight.
\item $\Sigma = \{1, 2,...,n\}$, $F = \{ f_x, f_y \}$, where $f_x(i) = x_i$, $f_x(i) = y_i$.
\item
$\Expt = \big\{ (2\cdot m,\; \{\{1,...,2m\}\},\; \outcome_m) \| 1 <= m <= n/2 \big\}$, where
\begin{flalign*}
\outcome(w_m) = \big\{ & f_x(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$m) \vee f_y(\$m+1) \vee ... \vee f_y(\$2m), & \\
& f_y(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_y(\$m) \vee f_x(\$m+1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$2m), & \\
& \neg\; (f_x(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_x(\$2m) \vee f_y(\$1) \vee ... \vee f_y(\$2m)) \big\}. &
\end{flalign*}
In this formalization, the variables correspond one-to-one to possible codes,
 so the outcome formulas effectively list all possibilities. \eqed
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% EXAMPLE: MASTERMIND 2

\begin{example}[Mastermind] \label{ex:form-mastermind}
Mastermind game with $n$ pegs and $m$ colours can be formalized as
a code-breaking game
$\mathcal{M}_{n,m} = (\Var, \init, \Sigma, F, \Expt)$
  with the following components.

\begin{itemize}
\item
$\Var = \{x_{i,j} \| 1<=i<=n, 1<=j<=m \}$.
  Variable $x_{i,j}$ tells whether there is colour $j$ at position $i$.
\item
$\init = \bigwedge\left\{
  \exactlyk{1} \{x_{i,j} \| 1<=j<=m\} \| 1<=i<=n\right\}$, saying that
  there is exactly one colour at each position.
\item $\Sigma = \{1,...,m\}$, \\
 $F = \{ f_1, ..., f_n \}$, where $f_i(c) = x_{i,c}$ for $1<=i<=n$, \\
 $\Expt = \{ (n, P, \outcome) \}$.\\
There is only one parametrized experiment with $n$ parameters corresponding
  to the colours.
All parameters can be the same,
  so the partition $P$ is the discrete partition $\{\{1\},...,\{n\}\}$.
\item $\outcome = \{ \texttt{Outcome}(b, w) \| 0<=b<=n, 0<=w<=n, b+w<=n \}$,
where $\texttt{Outcome}$ function is computed by the algorithm described below.
\end{itemize}

As described in \autoref{sec:mm},
  the outcome of an experiment corresponds
  to some maximal matching between
  the pegs in the code and the pegs in the guess.
The idea here is to generate a formula that asserts
  existence of such maximal matching
  with $b$ edges corresponding to black markers and
  $w$ edges corresponding to white markers.

The computation of \texttt{Outcome} $(b, w)$ is performed as follows.
First, we generate all admissible matchings.
Let $P = \{1,2,...,n\}$ be the set of positions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Select $B\subseteq P$ such that $|B| = b$.
  These are the positions at which the colour
  in the code matches the colour in the guess.
  They correspond to the black markers.
\item Select $W\subseteq P\times P$ such that $|W| = w$,
  $p_1(W)\cap B = \emptyset$, and $p_2(W)\cap B = \emptyset$,
  where $p_1$, $p_2$ are projections.
  These correspond to the white markers; $(i, j) \in W$ means that the colour
  at position $i$ in the guess is at position $j$ in the code.
\end{itemize}

Recall that $\inguess{i}$ denotes position $i$ in the guess
  and $\incode{i}$ denotes position $i$ in the code.
For a fixed combination $(B, W)$, we define matchin $M$ by
 $M = \{(\inguess{i}, \incode{i}) \| i\in B \} \cup
      \{(\inguess{i}, \incode{j}) \| (i, j)\in W \}$.
We construct a parametrized formula
  that asserts that $M$ is the maximal matching satisfying conditions in \autoref{sec:mm}
  for a guess $\$1,\$2,...,\$n$ and the code given by a valuation of the variables.
The formula has a form of a conjunction constructed in the following way.
\begin{itemize}
\item For $i\in B$, we add $f_i(\$i)$.
  This asserts that $(\inguess{i}, \incode{i})$ is an edge in the matching.
\item For $(i,j)\in W$, we add $f_j(\$i) \wedge \neg f_i(\$i) \wedge \neg f_j(\$j)$.
  This asserts that the colour $\$i$ is at position $j$ in the code and that
  $(\inguess{i}, \incode{i})$, $(\inguess{j}, \incode{j})$ cannot be edges
  in the matching.
\item For $(i,j)\in (P\setminus B\setminus p_1(W))
             \times (P\setminus B\setminus p_2(W))$, we add $\neg f_j(\$i)$.
  This asserts that no edge can be added and the matching is maximal.
\end{itemize}

The result of $\texttt{Outcome}(b, w)$ is a disjunction
  of all the conjunctions constructed in this way
  for all combinations of $B$ and $W$.
For example, for $n = 4$, $B = \{1\}$ and $W = \{2, 3\}$, the generated formula is
\[ f_1(\$1) \wedge f_3(\$2) \wedge \neg f_2(\$2) \wedge \neg f_3(\$3)
  \wedge \neg f_2(\$3) \wedge \neg f_2(\$4) \wedge \neg f_4(\$3) \wedge \neg f_4(\$4). \]

The number of combinations for $B$ and $W$ grows exponentially
  with $n$ and so does the size of generated formulas.
For $n = 4$, the result of $\texttt{Outcome}(1, 1)$
contains 24 clauses at the top level with 192 literals in total.\eqed

% For completeness, we show another way to formalize the Mastermind game,
%   which does not need algorithmic generation of the formulas.
% Let
%   $\mathcal{M'}_{n,m} = (\Var, \init, \Expt, \Sigma, \Exp, F, \outcome)$,
%   where

% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\Var$, $\init$, $\Sigma$, $F$ are defined as before.
% \item
% $\Expt = \{ g_{k_1,...,k_m} \| k_i \in \{1,...,n\}, \sum_ik_i = n \}$,\\
% $\Sigma = C$, \\
% $\Exp = \{(g_{k_1,...,k_m}, \param) \| \param\in\Sigma^{n},
%   \numpred{i}{\param[i]=j}=k_j\}$.\\
% The type $g_{k_1,...,k_m}$ covers all the guesses in which the number of $j$-coloured pegs is $k_j$.
% Therefore, two guesses for which we use the same pegs (pegs are just shuffled) are of the same type,
% but if we change a peg for one with different colour, it is other type of experiment.

% \item
% $F = \{ f_1, ..., f_n \}$, where $f_i(c) = x_{i,c}$ for $1<=i<=n$,
% \vspace{-2mm}
% \begin{flalign}
% \outcome(& g_{k_1,...,k_n}) =  \Big\{ &\\
%  & \exactlyk{b}\{ f_i(\$i) \| 1<=i<=n \} \;\wedge & \label{eq:mm-blacks}\tag{1}\\
%  & \exactlyk{t}\bigcup
%       \big\{
%            \{ \atleast{l}(x_{1,j},...,x_{n,j}) \| 1 <= l <= k_j \}
%            \| 1<=j<=m
%       \big\} & \label{eq:mm-whites}\tag{2}\\
%   &\hspace{2cm} \| 0<=b<=t, 0<=t<=n\Big\}.
% \end{flalign}
% \end{itemize}

% Part \eqref{eq:mm-blacks} of the formula captures the number of
%   the black markers.
% Part \eqref{eq:mm-whites} captures the total number of markers.
% Indeed, we get $k$ markers for colour $j$
%   if and only if $k < k_j$ and there are
%   at least $k$ pegs of colour $j$ in the code, i.e. all the formulas
%   $\atleast{i}(x_{1,j},...,x_{n,j})$ are satisfied for $i <= k$.
% Note that since the number of pegs of each colour is fixed by the type and we
%   do not care about the exact positions, this part of the formula
%   is not parametrized. \eqed
