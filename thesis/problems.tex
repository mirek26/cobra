\chapter[Examples of code-breaking games and existing results]{Game examples and existing results} \label{ch:games}
Several examples of code-breaking games are introduced in this chapter.
The counterfeit coin problem and Mastermind are quite well known,
  the other examples are based on various board games or less known
  logic puzzles.
We briefly summarize related research for each game, discuss
  its variations and applications and give a list of
  references.

% Our goal in this work is neither to answer the research questions, nor
%   to study possible generalizations.
% We aim to create a general formalism and a computer language which could
%   be used to describe arbitrary code-breaking game, if possible.
% This chapter provides an overview of what we had in mind
%   when we designed the framework and the language described
%   in the rest of the thesis.

The problem of finding a counterfeit coin among
  a collection of genuine coins in the fewest
  number of weighings on a balance scale is a folklore of
  recreational mathematics.

In all problems of this kind, you can only use the scale to weigh the coins.
You put some coins on the left pan, the same number of coins on the right pan
  and get one of the three possible outcomes.
Either both the sides weigh the same (denoted ``=''),
  or the left side is lighter (``$<$''),
  or the right side is lighter (``$>$'').
The easiest version of the problem can be formulated as follows.

\begin{problem}[The nine coin problem] \label{pr:coins9}
You are given $n >= 3$ (typically 9) coins, all except one having the same weight.
The counterfeit coin is known to be lighter.
Identify the counterfeit coin in the minimal number of weighings.
\end{problem}

This problem is very easy as we can use a \emph{ternary search} algorithm
  to identify the underweight coin.
In short, we divide the coins into thirds and put one third on the left pan and
  another on the right pan of the balance scale.
If both pans weigh the same, the counterfeit coin must be among the unused coins.
Otherwise, it is one of the coins on the lighter pan.
In this way, the size of the search space is reduced
  by a factor of three in each step, which is optimal.
In 1940s, more complicated version was introduced by Grossman\cite{coins-grossman1945}.

%whether the counterfeit coin is underweight or overweight
\begin{problem}[The twelve coin problem] \label{pr:coins12}
You are given $n >= 3$ (typically 12) coins, all except one having the same weight.
It is not known whether the counterfeit coin is heavier or lighter.
Identify the counterfeit coin and its weight relative to the others
  in the minimal number of weighings.
\end{problem}

The optimal solution for $n=12$ requires 3 weighings.
One of the optimal
  strategies is shown in \autoref{fig:coins12tree} as a decision tree.

\begin{figure}[ht]

$x$ means that the $x$-th coin is lighter, $\underline{x}$ means that
the $x$-th coin is heavier.}
\label{fig:coins12tree}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Known results}

The research of the problems has mostly focused
  on finding bounds on the maximal value of $n$
  for which the problem can be solved in $w$ weighings, for a given $w$.
The following theorem presents a sample result of this kind.

\begin{theorem}[Dyson, \cite{coins-dyson1946}]\label{th:coins12}
There is a strategy that identifies the counterfeit coin and
  its type as described in \autoref{pr:coins12} in $w$ weighings,
  if and only if
  \[ 3 <= n <=\frac{3^w - 3}{2}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show the main part of the original Dyson's proof\cite{coins-dyson1946}
  here because of its elegant combinatorial idea.
We show a strategy for $n = \frac{1}{2}(3^w - 3)$.

Let us number the coins from $1$ to $n$.
To the $i$-th coin, we assign
  two labels from the set $\{0,1,2\}^w$ -- those corresponding to the numbers
  $i$ and $3^w - 1 - i$ in ternary form.
Notice that all labels from the set are used exactly once, except for $0^w, 1^w$
  and $2^w$, which were not assigned to any coin.
The labelling has the property that
  one label of a coin
  can be obtained form the other another by substituting zeros with twos
  and vice versa.

A label is called ``clockwise'' if the leftmost change of digit in it is
a change from $0$ to $1$, from $1$ to $2$, or from $2$ to $0$.
Otherwise, the label is called ``anticlockwise''.
Due to the above property, one label of a coin is always
  clockwise and the other is anticlockwise.

Let $C(i, d)$ be the set of coins
  with the symbol $d$ at the $i$-th position of their clockwise label.
Since a substitution of $0$ with $1$, $1$ with $2$ and $2$ with $0$ in the coin labels
  transfers all the coins from $C(i,0)$ to $C(i,1)$,
        from $C(i,1)$ to $C(i,2)$ and
        from $C(i,2)$ to $C(i,0)$,
  all the sets $C(i, d)$ contain exactly $n/3$ coins.
Now, let the $i$-th experiment be the weighing of the set $C(i,0)$ against $C(i, 2)$.
We show that these experiments uniquely identify the counterfeit coin.

Let $a_i$ be 0, 1, and 2 if the result of $i$-th experiment is
  $<$, $=$ and $>$, respectively.
If the counterfeit code is overweight, the $i$-th symbol of its \emph{clockwise} label
  must be $a_i$. On the other hand, if it is underweight, the $i$-th symbol of
  its \emph{anticlockwise} label must be $a_i$.
Therefore, the counterfeit coin must the label $a_1a_2...a_w$
  and it is overweight if and only if this label is clockwise.
\autoref{fig:coins12scheme} shows an example of the construction for
  $n = 12 = \frac{1}{2}(3^3 - 3)$ with clockwise labels printed in bold.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pictures/coins12-th.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Demonstration of the ternary label construction for $n=12$.}
\label{fig:coins12scheme}
\end{figure}

The case $n < \frac{1}{2}(3^w - 3)$ can be solved similarly with minor modifications
  to the labelling.
However, the strategy makes use of a genuine coin discovered in the first
  weighing, so we cannot define other experiments without the knowledge
  of the outcome of the first.
Finally, the proof that the coin cannot be identified for
  $n > \frac{1}{2}(3^w - 3)$ can be carried out using information theory.\qed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Generalizations and related research}

Naturally, the problem has been generalized in various ways and
  studied by many authors.
In ``Coin-Weighing Problems''\cite{coins-cwproblems1995}, Guy and Nowakovski
  gave a great overview of the research in the area until 1990s
  with an extensive list of references.
We list the most interesting variations and generalizations below.

\begin{description}
\item[Weight of the counterfeit coin.]
  Either it is known whether the counterfeit coin is underweight or overweight,
  or it is not.
  Due to its simple nature, the first option allows for more generalizations,
  but both problems have been heavily researched.
\item[Number of counterfeit coins.]
  There is exactly one counterfeit coin in the original version of the problems.
  Naturally, a variation of \autoref{pr:coins9} with 2 and 3 counterfeit coins
   have been studied\cite{coins-2fakes}\cite{coins-3fakes} and some results
   have been generalized for $m$ counterfeit coins\cite{coins-mfakes}.
  Some authors have also studied the problem for an unknown number of
  counterfeit coins\cite{coins-unknownfakes},
  or for \emph{at most} $m$ counterfeit coins\cite{coins-atmostfakes}.
\item[Additional regular coin(s).]
  In some cases, it may help if an additional genuine coin (or more coins)
    is available.
  For example, for $n = 13$ in \autoref{pr:coins12}, you need 4 weighings in
  the worst-case.
  However, if you are given one extra genuine coin, the solution can be
    determined in 3 weighings\cite{coins-dyson1946}.
\item[Non-adaptive strategies.]
  In this popular variation of the problem, you have to announce all experiments
    in advance and then just collect the result.
  In other words, later weighings must not depend on the outcomes of the earlier weighings.
  Notice that the strategy constructed in the proof of \autoref{th:coins12} for
  $n = \frac{1}{2}(3^w - w)$ is indeed non-adaptive.
  However, the original proof uses an adaptive strategy for $n<\frac{1}{2}(3^w - w)$.
  This was later amended, showing that there always exists an optimal strategy for
  \autoref{pr:coins12} that is non-adaptive\cite{coins-nonadaptive}.
\item[Unreliable balance.]
  This generalization introduces the possibility that
  one (or more) answers may be erroneous.
  The problem of errors/lies in general deductive games is well studied\cite[see][]{games-lies}.
  It was applied on the counterfeit coin problem (\autoref{pr:coins9} variant)
  in \cite{coins-unreliable} with at most one erroneous outcome or in
  \cite{coins-unreliable2} with two.
\item[Multi-pan balance scale.]
  In this variation, the balance scale has $k$ pans.
  You put the same number of coins on every pan and
    you get either the information that all
    weigh the same or the information which arm is lighter or heavier
    than others\cite{coins-multiplearm}.
\item[Parallel weighing.]
  In this generalization, you have 2 (or more)
    balance scales and you can weigh different coins on
    the two scales simultaneously, which counts
    as one experiment\cite{coins-parallel}.
  The motivation here is that weighing takes significant time
    the goal is to minimize the time the whole process takes.

\section{Mastermind} \label{sec:mm}

\emph{Mastermind} is a classic code-breaking board game for 2 players,
  invented by Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970.
One player has the role of a \emph{codemaker} and the other of a \emph{codebreaker}.
First, the codemaker chooses a secret combination of $n$ coloured pegs.
Colour repetitions are allowed.
Then the codebreaker strives to reveal the code by making guesses.
The codemaker evaluates each guess with black and white markers.
A black marker corresponds to a position where the code and the guess match.
A white marker means that some colour is present both in the code
  and in the guess but at different positions.
The markers in the outcome are not ordered, so the codebreaker does not know
  which marker correspond to which peg in the guess.
Codebreaker's goal is to find out the colour combination in the minimal number of guesses.

More formally, let $C$ be a set of colours of size $c$.
We define a distance $d : C^n\times C^n -> \Nseto\times\Nseto$
  of two colour sequences by $d(u, v) = (b, w)$, where
\[
b = |\{ i \in\Nset \| u[i] = v[i] \}|
\]
\[
w = \sum_{j\in C} \min\big(\big|\{ i \| u[i] = j \}\big|,\;
                           \big|\{ i \| v[i] = j\}\big|\big)  - b.
\]
If the codemaker's secret code is a sequence $h\in C^n$ and the codebreaker's guess is
  a sequence $g\in C^n$,
  the guess is awarded $b$ black pegs and $w$ white pegs, where
  $(b,w) = d(h,g)$.
Therefore, if the codebreaker have made guesses $g_1, g_2, ..., g_k$ and the outcomes
  have been $(b_1,w_1), ..., (b_k, w_k)$,
  the search space is reduced to the codes
  \[
  \{ u\in C^n \| \forall i<=k.\; d(u, g_i) = (b_i,w_i)\}.
  \]

  \caption{Guess evaluation by maximal matching.}
  \vspace{-5mm}
\end{wrapfigure}

\newcommand{\incode}[1]{#1^\bullet}
\newcommand{\inguess}[1]{#1_\bullet}

Another way of looking at the guess evaluation is using
  \emph{maximal matching} of the pegs in the code $h$ and the guess $g$.
A matching is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges between
  the pegs in the guess (represented by $\inguess{i}$ for $1<=i<=n$) and
  the pegs in the code (represented by $\incode{i}$ for $1<=i<=n$).
Let $M_{g, h}$ be a maximal matching such that

\begin{enumerate}
\item an edge connects only pegs of the same colour, i.e. if $(\inguess{i},\incode{j})\in M_{g, h}$, then $h[i] = g[j]$, and
\item if $h[i] = g[i]$ then $(\inguess{i},\incode{i})\in M_{g, h}$.
\end{enumerate}

Maximality of the matching means that no edge can be added without breaking one of the conditions.
The edges in $M_{g, h}$ correspond to the markers in the outcome,
  a marker being black if and only if the corresponding edge connects $\inguess{i}$
  with $\incode{i}$ for some $i$.

\subsection{Known results and related research}

Much research has been done on Mastermind, authors focusing
  on \emph{exact values}, \emph{asymptotics} (e.g. \cite{mm-chvatal}), or
  computer generated strategies.
One of the fundamental theoretical results is that
  \emph{Mastermind satisfiability problem}, asking
  whether there exists at least one valid solution for a
  given set of guesses and their scores, is NP-complete\cite{mm-np}.

The goal for strategy synthesis is either to minimize
  \emph{the worst-case number of guesses}
  or \emph{the expected number of guesses}, given that the code
  is selected from the set of possible codes with uniform distribution.

Knuth\cite{mm-knuth} proposed a strategy that chooses a guess
  that minimizes the maximal number of remaining possibilities over all
  possible outcomes.
In the following, we call this strategy ``max-models''.
In the worst-case, it requires 5 guesses in the standard $n=4$, $c=6$ variant,
  which can be shown to be optimal.
In the average case, the strategy makes $4.48$ guesses.

Other authors proposed similar strategies.
Irving\cite{mm-expnum} suggested minimizing the expected number
  of remaining possibilities (``exp-models''),
Neuwirth\cite{mm-entropy} proposed a strategy that maximizes
  the entropy of the number
  of possibilities in the next round (``ent-models'').
Many years later, Kooi\cite{mm-mostparts} came up with a simple strategy that
  maximizes the number of possible outcomes (``parts''),
  which is computationally less demanding and performs better that the previous two.
We call this type of strategies \emph{one-step look-ahead}.

Using a backtracking algorithm, Koyama and Lai\cite{mm-exp-opt} found
  the optimal strategy for the expected case, which performs $4.34$
  guesses on average.
The comparison of the described strategies is shown in \autoref{tbl:one-step}.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}

\footnotetext{Irwing's paper reports 4.395 as the expected number
 of experiments of this strategy.
 However, he states that his strategy selects the first two experiments
 on the basis of the expected number of models and the rest is done by
 exhaustive search.
 We were not able to reproduce this particular result and the
 paper contains several more irreproducible results,
 which was already pointed out in \cite{mm-mostparts}.
 The number reported by our tool when strictly following this strategy is 4.626.}
\stepcounter{footnote}
\footnotetext{We were not able to reproduce Neuwirth's result of 4.416,
 as he does not strictly follow the strategy as described.
 The number reported by our tool is 4.643.
}

Apart from \emph{one-step look-ahead} strategies,
  which do not scale very well for bigger $n$ or $c$,
  other approaches has been suggested.
Many authors tried to apply genetic algorithms
  (see \cite{mm-ga} for an exhaustive overview and references therein),
  other analysed various heuristic methods (e.g. \cite{mm-heuristic}).

\subsection{Variations and applications}

\begin{description}
\item[Bulls and Cows]
is an old game with a principle very similar to Mastermind.
The only difference is that it uses digits instead of colours and does not allow repetitions.
Slovesnov wrote an exhaustive analysis of the problem\cite[see][]{bullsandcows}.

\item[Static Mastermind] is a variation of the game in which all guesses
  must be made in one go.
First, the codebreaker prepares a set of guesses,
  then the codemakers evaluates all of them as usual and
  then the codebreaker has to determine the code from the outcomes.
This variation was introduced by Chvátal\cite{mm-chvatal} and
  partially solved (for $n<=4$) by Goddard\cite{mm-static},
  proving that for $4$ pegs and $k$ colours,
  the optimal strategy uses $k-1$ guesses.
Note that this corresponds to so-called \emph{non-adaptive} strategies
  for the counterfeit coin problem.

\item[Mastermind with black-markers], also called \emph{string matching},
  is a variation without white markers, i.e.
  the only information the codebreaker gets from a guess
  is the number of positions at which the guess is correct.
This problem was already studied by Erdős\cite{erdos-two} who gave some
  asymptotic results about the worst-case number of guesses.
Later, this problem found an application in genetics with a need of
  methods to select a subset of genotyped individuals for phenotyping
  \cite{mm-app-gen2}\cite{mm-app-gen}.

\item[Extended Mastermind] was introduced by Focardi and Luccio,
  who showed that it is strictly related to cracking bank PINs for accessing ATMs
  by so-called \emph{decimalization attacks}\cite{mm-pins}.
In this variation, a guess is not a sequence of colours but a sequence of
  sets of colours. For example, if there are six colours $\{A, B, C, D, E, F\}$
  and the code is $AECA$,
  you can make a guess $\{A\}, \{C,D,E\}, \{A,B\}, \{F\}$, which
  will be awarded two black markers (for the first two positions)
  and one white marker (for $A$ in the third set).
\end{description}

\section{Other games}
\subsection{Black Box}

Black Box is a code-breaking board game in which one player creates a
  puzzle by placing four marbles on a $8\times 8$ grid.
The other player's goal is to discover their positions
  by the use of ``rays''.
The codebreaker chooses a side of the grid and an exact row/column in which
  the ray enters the grid (thus having 32 choices).
For each ray, the codemaker announces the position where the ray emerged from the grid,
  or says ``hit'' if the ray directly hit a marble\cite{blackbox}.

The marbles interact with the rays in the following three ways.
\begin{description}
\item[Hit.] If a ray fired into the grid directly strikes a marble,
  the result is ``hit'' and the ray does not emerge from the box.
\item[Deflection.] If a ray does not strike a marble
  but it should pass to one side of a marble, the ray is
  ``deflected'' and changes its direction by 90 degrees.
\item[Reflection.] If a ray should enter a cell with marbles on both sides,
  it is ``reflected'' and returns back the same way it came.
  The same happens if a marble is at the edge of the grid
  and a ray is fired from a position next to it.
\end{description}

  \caption{An example of ambigous configuration\protect\footnotemark.}
  \label{fig:blackbox-ambigous}
\end{wrapfigure}

A few examples are shown in \autoref{fig:blackbox-rules}.
The first image shows rays that hit a marble,
  the second shows rays deflected multiple times and emerging from
  the box at a different place, and the third demonstrates
  the two cases in which a reflection happens.

Note that if the game is played with five or more marbles,
  they can be placed in the grid so that their position can
  not be uniquely determined.
\autoref{fig:blackbox-ambigous} shows an example of such
  problematic configuration.

Although Black Box is an interesting example of a code-breaking game,
  there are configurations for which the codebreaker has to fire a ray from
  all positions in order to discover the positions of the marbles.
This makes makes the game rather uninteresting from a research point of view.
However, the game has become a popular puzzle for children and
  its principle has been used in other board games such as \emph{Laser maze}\cite{lasermaze}.

\subsection{Code 777}

During the board game named \emph{Code 777}, players sit in a circle,
  each drawing three cards at the beginning.
Players must not look at their own cards but they put them to a rack in front of them
  so that other players can see them.
Each card has one of seven colours and contains a number from one to seven.
The goal of the players is to determine their own cards, using questions like
 ``Do you see more yellow sevens or blue fives?'', which the others answer\cite{code777}.

We can reformulate this as a code-breaking game in which a player
  receives some cards, each having several attributes, each of which can have
  multiple values.
A player's goal is to determine his cards using questions
  like ``Do I have more [A] or [B]'', where [A] and [B] are conditions on
  any subset of the attributes.
For example, if the attributes are number, colour, and shape, one can ask
  ``Do I have more triangles or green twos?''.

\subsection{Bags of gold}

Imagine you have 10 bags of gold coins.
You were tipped off that some of the bags may contain counterfeit coins,
  which weigh 9 grams instead of 10 but are otherwise indistinguishable.
Suppose all coins in one bag are the same.
You have a digital scale that can show you the exact weight of a set of coins.
How to identify the bags with counterfeit coins in
  the minimal number of weighings?
Suppose there is a sufficient number of coins in each bag.

In the original version of this riddle, the scale has unlimited capacity and
  there is exactly one bag with counterfeit coins.
In that case, the secret can be revealed in a single experiment.
You take one coin from the first bag, two coins from the second and so on up to
  10 coins from the last bag.
You put all those 55 coins on the scale and, if they are all genuine,
  they weigh 550 grams.
If the weight is by $x$ grams lower, there must be exactly $x$ counterfeit
  coins on the scale and, therefore,
  the $x$-th bag is the one with counterfeit coins.

The game gets more interesting if the capacity of the scale is limited, or
  if there are more bags with a limited number of coins.
A special case in which each bag contains a single coin is
  studied in \cite{erdos-two}, and is shown to be very similar to
  Mastermind with black-markers.
Otherwise, the game lives only in the form of a logic puzzle and,
  to the best of our knowledge, no general results have been established.
